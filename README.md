# APM
This is a simplified implementation of a data-driven bottleneck detection method, namely, Active Period Method (APM), originally proposed by "Roser, Christoph, Mukund Subramaniyan, Anders Skoogh, and Björn Johansson. “An Enhanced Data-Driven Algorithm for Shifting Bottleneck Detection.” IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology 630 IFIP (September 5, 2021): 683–89. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-85874-2_74."
